# Railway Sanitary Product Management System

## Overview

This project is a **C++ based Sanitary Product Management System** developed to streamline inventory and supplier handling of sanitation-related materials. The system enables structured tracking of stock movement, product information, supplier records, and transaction logs through an object-oriented console application.

It was designed with a focus on simplicity, maintainability, and practical usability in real operational environments.

## Internship Context

This system was developed during my internship at **Bluestar Sanitary Private Limited** (June – July 2024).
As part of my responsibilities, I worked on simplifying internal management processes related to sanitary product handling and inventory organization.

The project served as a prototype tool demonstrating how digital tracking can:

* Reduce manual record keeping
* Improve stock visibility
* Enable structured supplier tracking
* Provide traceable transaction logs
* Simplify operational workflows

The implementation reflects real-world requirements observed during the internship period.

## Features

* Product Inventory Management
* Supplier Registration
* Stock In / Stock Out Tracking
* Transaction Logging with Timestamp
* File-Based Data Persistence
* Menu-Driven User Interface
* Object-Oriented Architecture

---

## Technologies Used

* C++
* Standard Template Library (STL)
* File Handling
* Object-Oriented Programming

---

## System Structure

The system is designed around modular classes:

* **Product** — Stores item details and quantity
* **Supplier** — Maintains supplier information
* **Transaction** — Records inventory changes
* **InventorySystem** — Handles system operations

This modular design allows easy expansion into GUI, database, or web-based systems.

* Practical application of OOP principles
* Real-world system design thinking
* Data handling and persistence
* Workflow analysis and simplification
* Translating operational needs into software solutions

## Future Enhancements

* Database integration (SQL)
* Authentication and user roles
* GUI interface
* Barcode/QR inventory tracking
* Multi-location inventory sync
* Automated low-stock alerts
